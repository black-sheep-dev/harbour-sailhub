SailHub is an inoffical native GitHub app for Sailfish OS using GitHub GraphQL API (v4).

I made this app to get familiarize myself with GraphQL API concepts. GitHub API is well documented and ideal for my purpose.

## Current state of development

The development is in an early state at the moment.  
Lot of functionality is missing.  
The authentication is done with an access token. You need to generate one on your GitHub profile page first.

## Implemented Features
- Search Repos and Users
- Follow User

- Two-Factor Authentication with OAuth2 (Qt OAuth2 functionality needs at least Qt 5.8 / Sailfish OS 3.4 has antique Qt 5.6 libraries)
- Complete access to all informations (issues, commits, branches, etc.)
- Feature requests
- ...
