# SailHub
SailHub is an inoffical native GitHub app for Sailfish OS using GitHub GraphQL API (v4).

I made this app to familiarize myself with GraphQL API concepts. GitHub API is well documented and ideal for this purpose.

## Current state of development

The development is in an early state at the moment.  
Lot of functionality is missing.

## Authentication with Personal Access Token
To authenticate with GitHub API a personal access token is necessary. You can create one in developer settings on GitHub profile settings page.
